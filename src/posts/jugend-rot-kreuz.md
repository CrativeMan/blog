## âœš "Das Jugendrotkreuz"

The youth red cross is the (obv.)youth organisation of the red cross. It teaches children and teenagers from ~6 until 27 years old first aid and the principles of the red cross. I have been a part of my local group for over ~10ish years now and i have loved every second. 

I have joined when i was 7 years old and still in Elementary school. I really enjoyed it. The whole concept of first aid was really interesting to me. We learned how to talk to people who are hurt. How to call for help using the local EMS. But we also had lots of fun, playing or doing fun activities. There are also contests where multiple different *jrk*(short for the German version of the youth red cross) groups compete against each other in multiple disciplines like first aid but also general knowledge, the history of the red cross, crafting and theatrics or play. This is one of the most fun experiences i have from my childhood. 

Now that i am older i am still a part of my local group but now i am in the position of "Gruppen Leiter" or group leader. Which means i prepare and hold our weekly *lessons* and take responsibility in preparing my group(s) for the contests. It is a honorary job or "Ehrenamtlich" in german, which means that you don't get any money for doing it. It is a really fun thing todo and i have learned a lot from it. My *fear* of public speaking has significantly lowered and i am more comfortable in general talking in front of people.

### How it has helped me

I have met so many kind, nice and just plain good people through the red cross and the youth groups. I have never met anybody that was just plain rude in the red cross. I really like that. I have found kind of a second *family* when i am there. I just really like it.
